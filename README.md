# Inassembly
is a relatively unstable web framework that still needs lots of work.

## Concept

Build applications in the same fashion as React, a component based library, with less setup.
Create applications that downloads the components as the user navigates.

## Locations
```root/Inassembly.js``` is the file for the front-end library.

```root/compiler/index``` is the file for the back-end compiler/parser.
